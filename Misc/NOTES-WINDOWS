	BUILDING AND RUNNING SUBC ON WINDOWS

	All Windows-related code in the runtime system has been
	generously supplied by Jean-Marc Lienher (http://cod5.org).
	I am afraid I am not able to answer any questions about it,
	because I know nothing about Windows.

	The Windows version of SubC requires the MinGW infrastructure,
	but does not use the GNU libc. To build the compiler, the MSYS
	environment of MinGW is needed.

	Disclaimer: I have never used Windows, so building SubC on
	Windows will probably not go smoothly. Here are some hints.

	* All files in this package are in Unix file format (LF line
	  terminators). Although the compiler should ignore CR's in
	  its input, it is probably best to keep the files in Unix
	  format.

	* DO NOT use "make". It probably will not work. Use the
	  WINBUILD.BAT script instead. (If you still want to use
	  make, set the EXESFX variable in src/Makefile to .exe).

	* There are symlinks in this archive, which the TGZ extractor
	  probably will break. WINBUILD.BAT should restore them.

	* All stdio functions of the SubC library use Unix text file
	  format, i.e. '\n' translates to LF.

	* The system() function assumes that your command interpreter is
	  "c:\\windows\\system32\\cmd.exe".

	* signal() returns SIG_ERR and does nothing.

	* raise() does nothing.

	If you still want to try SubC on Windows:

	Good Luck!

	(You will probably need it!)

# Warren's Play Area

Here I've got some programs that I'm playing with that are
related to the SubC material:

 + `cgopt41.c`: A combination of the `cg4.c` and `opt1.c` programs from
   the `../book` directory.
 + `optint.c`: An extension to `cgopt41.c` which has print and
    assignment statements.

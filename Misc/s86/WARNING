	The S86 tool chain contained in this directory is a work
	in (slow) progress. It was originally designed as a 16-bit
	native DOS-hosted tool chain, and has then been hacked to
	serve as a cross compiler back end hosted on a 32-bit (or
	64-bit) system. Expect bugs!

	Do not try to compile these programs with anything but
	SubC (or at least make sure that char is unsigned and
	CHAR_MAX is 255).
